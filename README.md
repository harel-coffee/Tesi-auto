# Model-agnostic explanations of black box classifiers for image recognition


This repository contains the source code of my master thesis 
(Model-agnostic explanations of black box classifiers for image recognition) and the annotated data
set used in the experiments.

## Folders structure:

- `chosen_1000_images` contains the 1000 images used in the experiments
- `immagini_ritagliate` contains the reference areas for each image in `chosen_1000_images`
- `master thesis` includes all the LaTeX files and pdf version of the thesis

## Relevant files:

- `predizioni_bb` contains the predictions of the black box on each of the 1000 images in the test set
- `chosen_classes_for_validation` specifies the chosen labels from the ILSVRC dataset
